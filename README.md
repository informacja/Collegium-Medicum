# Intra- and Inter-individual Spectral Pattern Variability of sEMG in Elbow Flexor Motor Tasks
## Overview
This repository contains data collected with Noraxon Ultium wireless hardware. 
## Structure
### Files
Go to project directory and run *main* script in console, just like below
```
main
```
This script takes raw EMG recordings, segments exercise repetitions, normalizes them, performs spectral and centroid analysis, compares conditions using multiple Minkowski distance formulations, and assembles publication-ready figures for an academic paper.
### Folders
All **.mat* files are in *data* folder

#### Protocol how to collect data can by found here: [PL prototkół](protokół.md)
